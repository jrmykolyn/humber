# Class 7

## Overview
The exercise for this class is split into 2 parts.

## Part 1
In this exercise you will continue to explore Git and GitHub in general, and branching in particular.

Start by coming up with _at least_ 3 trivia questions (for example: "Who created Git?"; "What is the Unix epoch"; "What is the largest positive number that can be represented using 8 bits of data?"). Then complete the following:

- Create a new local Git repository.
- Add the questions to a README.md document and commit the result.
- Create a new GitHub repository named: class-6-exercise-part-1.
- Connect the local and remote repository and push your trivia questions to GitHub.

After you've setup the repository in GitHub, create a new branch to answer each question. Each branch must contain no more than one answer. This means that if you define 3 questions then you should have 3 branches, each with 1 answer. You're free to make these updates locally or directly in GitHub. If you choose to work locally please make sure to push _all_ of your branches to the remote repository before submitting the exercise.

The subject matter for the questions is up to you, so feel free to have fun with them.

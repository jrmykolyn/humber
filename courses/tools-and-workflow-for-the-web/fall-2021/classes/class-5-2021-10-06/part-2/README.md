# Part 2

## Instructions
- Start by identifying _which_ shell configuration file is most relevant for your operating systems. Some examples include: `.zshrc`; `.bash_profile`; `.bashrc`.
- Create a new shell configuration file (with the appropriate name) in the repository that you started in part 1.
- Update the file so that it displays a useful welcome message whenever a new shell session is created. Commit the result.
- Update the file to include at least one alias. Commit the result.
- Update the file to include at least one function. Commit the result.
- Push your updates to the GitHub repository associated with your personal account.
- See the class page for additional submission instructions.

## Additional Notes
- The instructions above build on part 1 of the exercise. Make sure you complete that first!
- The content and format of the 'welcome' message are up to you, so use your imagination. Would you like to see a friendly message whenever you start a new terminal session? A helpful message?
- The functionality of the alias and function are also up to you. That said, they should be useful in some way. What are some things that you may end up doing frequently, and that you could 'wrap' in an alias or function?
- Everything within your shell configuration file must _work_, so make sure to test it thoughly. You can do this either by copying the file into your home directory and starting a new terminal session, or by using the `source` command to apply the contents of the file to the current shell session.

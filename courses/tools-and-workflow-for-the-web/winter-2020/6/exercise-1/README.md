# Part 1

## Introduction
Use this document as a starting point for Part 1 of the Class 6 exercise.

As part of this exercise you will create a series of 'trivia questions' and add them to this document. You will also provide an answer for each of the questions on a dedicated branch. Each branch must *only* contain the answer for the corresponding question (although it may also contain the other questions). See below for an example.

This question would appear on the `master` branch.
```
Q. What is the largest planet in the solar system?
```

The same question *and* the answer would appear on the dedicated 'answer branch'.
```
Q. What is the largest planet in the solar system?
